# WCS ACORN - Bioinformatics for Antimicrobial Resistance - Virtual 21 Mayâ€“6 June 2024

Interactive training for functional analysis and interpretation of disease data using computational modelling tools

## Course Overview

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is critical to monitor as it threatens modern medical and public health systems. The Clinically Oriented antimicrobial Resistance Network (ACORN) project is developing an effective AMR surveillance system across nine African and Asian countries.

This course aims to train ACORN team members across nine centres with core bioinformatics skills which can be utilised to analyse and identify resistance from pathogen genome data.

This course is virtual and will run twice a week from 21 May until 6 June 2024

## Course Content

This virtual bioinformatics course will offer a series of lectures and practical sessions including the following topics:

Pathogen genome assembly
Annotation of pathogen genomes
Phylogenetics in clinical contexts

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, participants will be able to:

Apply appropriate tools to analyse WGS data of bacterial genomes
Identify sequencing data formats
Use pathogen genomic analysis web-tools to process sequence data
Execute the basic processes of genome assembly for pathogen species
Identify and interrogate antibiotic resistance genes and mutations
Implement data workflows and bioinformatic analysis of genomic sequence data, including risk and resistance prediction for bacterial epidemiology and pandemic response
Conduct phylogenetic analysis in the context of outbreak and other epidemiological investigations
Compare phylogenetic trees for different species and outbreak scenarios
